# Embouchure 

A player's _embouchure_ is the formation of the lips and facial muscles to buzz through the mouthpiece. All human faces are generally the same, which means there is _generally_ a "correct" (or "effective") way to address the mouthpiece. All human faces are unique, which means each person's embouchure will be a little different. 

There's been a lot of research into how different embouchure formations work and what is or is not effective for playing brass instruments. Yet, embouchure development remains a poorly-understood aspect of brass playing. As a result, it's likely that most of the music teachers you work with will not focus much on embouchure development.

There are three general types of embouchures. Depending on your anatomy, one of these will feel more comfortable and natural to you than the others. Within that, you will find the exact placement of the lips on the mouthpiece that works best for you. 

Embouchure problems can be corrected, but it's better to start off in the right direction. Otherwise, there will come a time when you have to backtrack and build your embouchure again in a different way. The delay may interfere with achieving your goals for playing. Some guidance in this area is beneficial, as it's easy to get into bad habits. 

I want to avoid going into detail here, because your embouchure is unique to you, and we'll need to work on it in person. To give you a sense of how I approach it as a teacher, consider the explanations in the following videos and Internet resources.
