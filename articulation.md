# Articulation 

_Articulation_ is the use of the tongue or glottis to modify the style in which notes are started. Unfortunately, articulation is an aspect of brass playing that many teachers and musicians misunderstand. Therefore, it is an area of focus in my own private teaching. 




I often say you can find a great deal of useful information online and in books without relying on a private teacher to guide you. However, you must be careful to distinguish between accurate and inaccurate information. 

## The good, the bad, and the ugly Internet resources on articulation

### Example 1: [Article in Brass Pedagogy, Oct. 1, 2016](https://sites.lib.jmu.edu/brasspedagogy/2016/10/01/basic-articulation/)

Overall the article provides excellent information. I think some points deserve to be highlighted, and others call for some clarification or expansion. 

I want to call out this part of the article:

"Students should certainly demonstrate fundamental abilities to maintain their air stream, set their embouchures, and buzz on their mouthpieces before adding tongues into the equation. Yet, introduced and practiced properly, articulation should build on those skills rather than interfere."

Notice there is a distinction between buzzing and articulation. If a player can buzz without using the tongue, then clearly articulation cannot be the mechanism that starts notes. Remember this whenever you hear or read advice about articulation based on saying syllables, like _too_ and _doo_. 

The author goes on to say: "Fundamental articulation comprises three styles: slurring, separated tonguing, and connected tonguing." I think that's a good summary. 

The stylistic indications _legato_ and _sostenuto_ are examples of connected tonguing. The indications _marcato_, _staccato_, _leggiero_, and _secco_ are examples of separated tonguing. Slurring does not involve the tongue or glottis but can still be considered a form of articulation. 

In addition to those, I think of the _breath attack_ as another form of articulation. In fact, in my own playing I use the breath attack as the default way to start notes unless there is a specific reason to do otherwise. This goes back to my (possibly obsessive) preoccupation with minimizing extraneous noise when playing.

Later in the article, there is a discussion of syllables like _too_. In context, it's clear this is a shortcut to help beginning students place their tongues in more-or-less the right position inside their mouths. 

In my opinion, we should explain the syllable is a mnemonic device to help the player get started with articulation, and articulation as such isn't about saying syllables. Except for very young students, everyone should be able to understand a straightforward explanation of tongue position and tongue movement without recourse to syllables. When we play music, we are not enunciating syllables into our instrument.

The article doesn't mention articulation with the glottis. I think most teachers wouldn't mention this until they get to the subject of double and triple tonguing, and I think that's the reason so many players have difficulty with those forms of articulation. 

In my opinion, players should practice basic articulations at a slow tempo using both the tongue and the glottis, including playing double- and triple-tonguing patterns slowly. As they learn to articulate faster and to use multiple tonguing techniques, they don't feel as if they're doing anything special or different than usual; just faster. The results are often cleaner than when they only apply the glottis at faster tempos. 

Players who never practice articulation with the glottis except when double- or triple-tonguing rapidly tend to play sloppily and to have difficulty transitioning between single and multiple tonguing. 


### Example 2: [The Salvation Army Canada and Bermuda Territory Brass Course, Lesson 2.4: Tonguing and Articulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNhvpqtmezs) 

In my opinion, this well-intentioned video has the following issues: 

The title of the lesson reads, "Tonguing and Articulation," but there is never any explanation of the difference. 

The presenter says each note has a beginning, a middle, and an end. He then explains how to use different syllables to start a note in order to achieve various styles: _Too_, _Toh_, _Doo_, _Duh_. The idea of a beginning, middle, and end is reminiscent of the _envelope_ of a sound, but doesn't really explain that concept accurately or completely. He speaks of a "front" to each note, and describes how each of these four syllables affects it. 

This is sorta-kinda superficially not-entirely-wrong, but it is wrong enough to lead inexperienced players down the wrong path. Notes don't have a "front." A sound has an _envelope_ which consists of the _attack_, _sustain_, _decay_, and _release_. 

An articulation of some kind may be applied to the attack to achieve a given effect, like _staccato_ or _legato_, but the articulation is not what starts the sound. We start the sound by starting the buzz. When we start a note without articulation, it's called a _breath attack_. What syllable do you say to perform a breath attack? 

After offering a verbal explanation, the presenter demonstrates various articulations on the cornet. His note initiation is clear. It's possible he is not aware that he is doing two things when he initiates each note. He's thinking of the articulation and the act of starting the note as the same thing. 

His thinking that way does not appear to interfere with his playing, but in my view it's better to understand what's really happening. I've heard players who conflate articulation with starting the note who can't perform a breath attack. Sometimes they attack notes too strongly or sharply in musical contexts where that is inappropriate.
