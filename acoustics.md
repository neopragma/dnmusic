# Acoustics 

Not to belabor the obvious, but the euphonium and trombone are designed to produce _sound_. To become proficient with one of these instruments, it's helpful to understand a little bit about the subject of _sound_. 

There are three aspects of sound we need to be aware of. 

## The physics of sound - acoustics

First, there's the physics of sound; how it works whether anyone is listening or not. The answer to the old question, "If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?" is "Yes." 

The falling tree creates vibrations in the air. Those vibrations obey the laws of physics.

The physics of sound is called _acoustics_. We'll touch on acoustics a little more on this page, with the goal of helping you understand how learning about acoustics can help your playing. 

During a course of private lessons, you would be introduced to more information about acoustics and related topics.

## The human perception of sound

Second, there's the human perception of sound. Our ears and brains don't directly process sound as it exists physically. When sound waves reach our auditory canal, the vibrations are converted into signals that travel to the auditory cortex. 

What we experience as "hearing" is a little different from what's happening acoustically outside our bodies. _Music_ has to be produced with due consideration of how humans perceive sound. 

Interestingly, what we hear in our own heads when we speak, sing, or play an instrument is different from what other people hear. 

## Acoustical properties of instruments

Third, there's the way sounds are formed and sustained inside our instruments and inside our oral cavity when we play. 

This topic relates to the design and acoustical properties of the instruments we play.
