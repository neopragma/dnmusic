# Acoustics 

Not to belabor the obvious, but the euphonium and trombone are designed to produce _sound_. To become proficient with one of these instruments, it's helpful to understand a little bit about the subject of _sound_. 

There are three aspects of sound we need to be aware of. 

## The physics of sound - acoustics

First, there's the physics of sound; how it works whether anyone is listening or not. The answer to the old question, "If a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?" is "Yes." 

The falling tree creates vibrations in the air. Those vibrations obey the laws of physics. Physics doesn't care if anyone is listening.

The physics of sound is called _acoustics_. During a program of private lessons, you would be introduced to more information about acoustics and related topics in the context of building skills on your instrument.

## The human perception of sound

Second, there's the human perception of sound. Our ears and brains don't directly process sound as it exists physically. When sound waves reach our auditory canal, the vibrations are converted into signals that travel to the auditory cortex. 

Exactly how we experience those sensations depends on factors such as our health, the sensitivity of our ears, our memory, and our psychology.  

What we experience as "hearing" is a little different from what's happening acoustically outside our bodies. 

Interestingly, what we hear in our own heads when we speak, sing, or play an instrument is different from what other people hear. 

## Acoustical properties of instruments

Third, there's the way sounds are formed and sustained inside our instruments and inside our oral cavity when we play. 

This topic relates to the design and acoustical properties of the instruments we play. 

This is a particularly important topic for euphonium players to understand, due to the intonation problems inherent in valved brass instruments. Those problems are exacerbated in larger instruments, such as euphonium and tuba. 

Without going into too much detail, the issue is that the valve slides are of fixed length, while we need to add a _proportional_ length of tubing to lower the pitch by a given amount. That is, we need to add more length in the lower register than the higher register. 

So, the valve tubing lengths are a compromise - too short (sharp) for low notes, a little long (flat) for high notes, and more-or-less okay for the middle register. The intonation differences are easier to hear in larger instruments than smaller ones, so the problem is greatest for tuba and fairly significant for euphonium.

It's important to understand the design trade-offs the instrument maker made in creating the model of euphonium you are playing, in an attempt to enable the instrument to be played in tune. The valve slides are of different lengths in different models - three-valve, four-valve, five-valve, and four-valve compensating designs. 

In addition, instruments with different bore widths have slightly different acoustical properties. Different mouthpieces fitted into the receiver will affect intonation and how free-blowing the instrument is. On euphoniums with adjustable receiver gaps, different gap settings will affect intonation and other properties of the instrument. 

The player must make adjustments specific to the type of euphonium as well as their mouthpiece and their embouchure to ensure good intonation. The adjustments may include selecting an appropriate mouthpiece, adjusting the receiver gap (if possible), lipping the pitch up or down, setting the tuning slides to appropriate positions, and choosing alternate fingerings in selected musical passages. 

Besides all that, the intonation of the instrument changes as its temperature changes and as you warm up and then grow tired during playing sessions. 

It helps to understand a little about musical acoustics.

## Musical acoustics 

Musical acoustics is a multidisciplinary field that includes elements of acoustics, human perception, instrument design, and musical concepts. There's a good overview on Wikipedia here: [Musical Acoustics on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_acoustics). 

This page isn't the right place to go into details about frequency, amplitude, wave propagation, and all that. You can read about that online or in books, and we can cover it in private lessons. For now, let's just touch on a couple of basic points, to help clarify the inherent intonation problems of the euphonium and other valved brass instruments. 

Say we have a vibrating column of air of a certain length. Exactly how the air was put into motion isn't so important. Maybe we struck a key on a marimba, plucked a string on a viola, or played a note on a flute or clarinet or oboe or trumpet. 

The length of the vibrating column of air is its _wavelength_ or _frequency_. 

The pitch we're playing or singing is the _fundamental_ frequency. Additional pitches also sound, although they are much softer than the fundamental and we don't usually notice them individually. Those additional pitches are the _harmonics_ of the fundamental frequency.

The harmonics are integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. When we play a note on an instrument, all the harmonics are produced. The characteristic _timbre_ (recognizable quality of sound) of each instrument depends in large part on which harmonics are stronger (greater _amplitude_) and which are weaker (lesser _amplitude_) when we play that instrument. That's how we can recognize when we're hearing a bassoon versus a tuba versus a cello. 

There is more than that in the sounds we hear. Instruments also produce _overtones_, which are frequencies higher than the fundamental but not necessarily integer multiples of its wavelength. Overtones also contribute to the characteristic _timbre_ of each instrument. 

But for purposes of this page, the harmonics are more interesting than the overtones. Harmonics are also called _partials_. On a plain brass tube without any valves, the lowest note you can play cleanly is the _fundamental_, also called the _pedal tone_. Its wavelength is equal to the length of the tube. That is, there is exactly one wave resonating inside the tube. 

Using your embouchure to raise the pitch, the next note you can play cleanly is the _second partial_. Its frequency is one-half the length of the fundamental. There are two waves standing in the tube, each one-half the length of the tube. 

When you play the third partial, the wavelength is one-third that of the fundamental, and there are three waves standing in the tube. Any guesses about the fourth partial? The fifth partial? I think you get the idea. 

On a Bb euphonium, the fundamental is Bb1; the second partial is Bb2; the third is F3; the fourth is Bb3; the fifth is D4; the sixth is F4; the seventh is a flat Ab4, and the eighth partial is Bb4, or "high" Bb. 

If there were no valves on the euphonium, the partials of Bb1 would be the only notes we could play. To get the rest of the notes, we need to add tubing to the length of the bore. That's what the valves do. Each valve adds a certain length of tubing to the path the air takes from the mouthpiece to the bell. 

- 2nd valve - adds a minor second 
- 1st valve - adds a major second 
- 3rd valve - adds a minor third 

So to play a Bb, we leave the valves open. To play an A, we close the 2nd valve. For an Ab, we close the 1st valve. To play a G, we can use the 3rd valve or a combination of 1st and 2nd (minor second plus major second equals minor third). To play an F# (or any of its partials), we combine the 2nd and 3rd valves (minor second plus minor third equals major third). To play an F (or any of its partials), we combine the 1st and 3rd valves (major second plus minor third equals perfect fourth). To play an E (or any of its partials) we combine all three valves (major second plus minor second plus minor third equals tritone, or augmented fourth).

So far, so good, but there's a problem. To lower the pitch of Bb to A, we need to add a certain length of tubing. The amount of tubing we need to add is proportional to the wavelength of the partial we're playing - about 6% - but the length of each tube on the instrument is fixed, not proportional. Six percent of the wavelength of Bb2 is longer than 6% of the wavelength of Bb4.

Instrument makers deal with this by making the tubing a little too short for perfect intonation in the low register, and a little too long for perfect intonation in the upper register. Intonation is okay in the middle register. 

We can usually deal with intonation problems in the upper register either by lipping the pitch up a little or by using alternate fingerings. For example, on a Besson euphonium, I usually find A4 to be better in tune when I use valves 1 and 2 (9th partial over G), while on a Yamaha I find it to be better with valve 2 alone (8th partial over A).

The low notes are noticeably sharp. That's because we use multiple valves, each of which is already a little sharp on its own. 

There is no way to fix the intonation perfectly, but there are a couple of things instrument makers do to reduce the problem. One is to add valves that lengthen the overall length by additional intervals beyond those handled by the first three valves. The other is to add short lengths of tubing that only come into play when multiple valves are closed at the same time (this is called the _compensating_ system). 

So we have three-valve, four-valve, five-valve, and compensating four-valve euphoniums. On the latter three types, the first three valves are even more out of tune than on a three-valve instrument, because the expectation is you will use the fourth (and possibly fifth) valves to compensate for intonation problems in the low register. 

Dave Werden has a nice explanation on his site: [The Three- and Four-Valve Compensating System](https://www.dwerden.com/eu-articles-comp.cfm).

Something I've noticed about adult amateurs and young students is that they (or their parents) invest in an expensive euphonium with the compensating system or with five valves and then never use the fourth or fifth valves. They are even more out of tune than they would be if they played a three-valve instrument. Just purchasing a high-end euphonium doesn't automatically make anything happen (other than reducing your bank balance). You have to _use_ the equipment.

Non-compensating euphonium:
- 2 - adds a minor second 
- 1 - adds a major second 
- 3 - adds a minor third 
- 4 - adds a perfect fourth (123 are sharper than on a 3-valve instrument)
- 5 - adds a major third (1234 are sharper than on a 4-valve instrument)

Compensating euphonium:

Valves 123 are sharper than on a 3-valve instrument.
