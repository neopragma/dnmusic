# What do you need to know to master the euphonium? 

To master the euphonium - or at least to become reasonably proficient on it - you need to know a lot about a few things and a little about a lot of things. Here's an overview.

At first glance, it might seem as if you have to earn half a dozen PhD's just to play the thing; but it isn't so daunting. All these topics overlap and reinforce one another, and either directly or indirectly help you play better. 

In the course of private lessons, we'll touch on the information relevant to the skills you're working on at the moment and the direction you're taking with developing your skills to achieve your goals. 

Let's review these topics briefly and see how they apply to playing the instrument. 

## Sound 

As a musical instrument, the euphonium makes sounds. Therefore, we should understand something about the nature of sound.

There are many elements in this diagram, and it's probably not easy to read on a web page. Suffice it to say the yellow boxes pertain to the physics of sound - _acoustics_ - the red ones pertain to the human perception of sound, and the green ones pertain to how sound works in the instrument. 

The gray boxes represent information that might be of general interest, but that isn't strictly necessary to learn in order to master the euphonium.
