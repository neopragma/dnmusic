# Trombone Posture 

By _posture_ I mean the way we hold the instrument when sitting and when standing. The trombone is a well-balanced instrument. With most designs, there is more-or-less equal weight behind and in front of our left hand. 

Jass trombonist Luke Malewicz has prepared an excellent instructional video on the correct way to hold the trombone. He explains everything step by step. He also demonstrates and explains several common mistakes and how to correct them.

In his narration he speaks as if he's addressing young students, but his advice applies to everyone. I've seen plenty of adult amateur trombonists who hold the instrument incorrectly, and who could benefit from this information.

Luke's video is very detailed and can help you avoid creating stress in your neck, shoulder, and back as well as positioning your head in a way that interferes with your airway. His advice covers playing in the seated position very well. 

Amelia, a trombonist and yoga teacher, offers complementary advice in her video on trombone posture. She demonstrates correct posture when playing in the standing position, and also talks about positioning the music stand.

Luke demonstrates trombone posture using a basic Bb trombone such as most people use for jazz playing. Most instruments of this type are very well balanced front to back and easy to hold for long periods of time. 

Amelia uses a symphonic tenor trombone with a Thayer valve (also known as an axial flow valve) for the F attachment. The tubing for the F attachment adds a little weight behind your supporting hand. The Thayer valve is much heavier than a standard rotary valve, so it adds more weight. You need to be aware of this and not allow the weight difference to cause you to drift into poor posture.

Tim Smith of the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra has a video that demonstrates good posture for playing the trombone and offers tips for positioning the music stand so that there's no interference with the slide and so that the player can see the conductor clearly.

In addition to basic information found in all these videos, Tim's description of the left forearm as a pillar of support is particularly valuable. It will help you avoid fatigue and possible damage to your wrist over time. 

He also published a one-page guide to good trombone posture. It's a PDF you can download for reference.

## Numbness or pain in the left arm

If you experience numbness or pain in your left hand, wrist, and/or forearm, it's likely your left hand position is a little off, and you're straining to hold the instrument. The strain may be slight, and you may not notice any discomfort when you first start playing. 

It should not become uncomfortable or painful to hold the trombone. If it happens, take it as a sign that you should review your grip and hand/arm position. 

## Orientation of the right wrist 

In the videos above, the trombonists demonstrate a way of holding the slide that naturally positions the wrist such that the palm of the hand is facing the musician and the back of the hand is facing the audience. They don't belabor this point in their videos, but I think it's important. 

Many players hold the slide in a way that causes the palm of the hand to face the floor. Hold your arm and wrist that way for a moment and try moving just the wrist and not the elbow as if you were operating your slide. It's not very comfortable, is it? 

Now turn your wrist so the palm is facing you and try the same motion. It feels much more natural and fluid, doesn't it? 

Some players think they must move the slide in a way that approximates valves. They try to move the slide from position to position instantaneously, and sort of "snap" it into each position There are times when the music calls for very precise changes in slide position. There are other times when the "slidey" character of the trombone is wanted. 

#### Example 1: Tam O'Shanter

One such piece is Malcolm Arnold's "Tam O'Shanter." It's a musical interpretation of the Robert Burns poem of the same name, depicting a drunken man who thinks he sees witches pursuing him in the night. 

Here's a demonstration of one of the solo passages from that piece by trombonist Matthew Gee.

[Matthew Gee - trombone solo from "Tam O'Shanter"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eai23ZISE_E)

Not to criticize - he's a fine trombonist - but I wanted to share this particular example to illustrate using the "snappy" slide technique in music that calls for the "slidey" technique. For contrast, consider this performance of John Paynter's transcription for concert band. Unfortunately, we can't see the trombonist during the solos, but we can hear that he's playing the music in a more "slidey" way than the first example.

[U.S. Navy Band - "Tam O'Shanter"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPlNzeS5tdk)

Key moments:
- 1:50 - trombone solo 
- 3:30 - glissandi
- 3:50 - trombone solo 
- 5:40 - glissandi
- 7:05 - "Well done, Cutty Sark!"

The U.S. Navy Band's interpretation is a little more in character for the piece, in my opinion. To my taste, the following performance by the Deutsches Filmorchester Babelsberg is even more expressive of the intent of the music. The soloist is on camera during the first solo, and we see that he lets the slide glide and also takes some liberties with tempo, which enhances the "drunken" effect. 

[Deutsches Filmorchester Babelsberg - "Tam O'Shanter"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIcIU4o61WQ)

Key moments:
- 1:42 - trombone solo
- 3:17-3:30 - glissandi 
- 3:46-4:08 - trombone solo 
- 5:20 - glissandi 
- 6:58 "Well done, Cutty Sark!"

#### Example 2: Bolero 

The well-known trombone solo in Maurice Ravel's "Bolero" is another case for letting the slide slide, rather than snapping it into position for each note. 

In this video, S.J. Park demonstrates the solo:

[S.J. Park - "Bolero"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ahWiS--CUU)

In my opinion, this interpretation does not express the composer's intent. It's very clipped and the articulations are too pointed for the style of the music. This solo has to be very loose and slippery.

Here's a demonstration by New York Philharmonic principal Joseph Alessi.

[Joseph Alessi - "Bolero"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ls7E2etqkgM)

This version is a lot freer and more fluid than the first example. But even this may be a little more "straight" than Ravel originally intended. 

In the video, Alessi states that it's important to play the glissandi that Ravel wrote in the part, but not to add any extra portamento beyond that. Most people play it just that way, but there's a lot of room for interpretation. 

Here's Matthew Gee imitating the style of Jacob Raichman's 1947 performance with the Boston Symphony and Serge Koussevitzky. It's quite the opposite of "slidey." 

[Matthew Gee channelling Jacob Rachman - "Bolero"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i51aJ3P0hhM)

This is Milosz Leniec with the Neue Philharmonie MÃ¼nchen in 2023:

[Milosz Leniec - "Bolero"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UA95a14Nqg)

Leniec does not add portamentos beyond what is written, but his slide technique is very fluid and relaxed. In my opinion this is in keeping with Ravel's intent, insofar as I understand his intent. 

Here's another good example. This is Alexey Lobikov with the Marlinsky Orchestra:

[Alexey Lobikov - "Bolero"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5SLpXOFStE)

Notice his level of comfort and control in the high register.

Although I haven't found any examples or stories about this online, when I was young I heard stories from older musicians who said Johannes Rochut used to play this solo with a great deal of liberty. Joe Alessi might not have approved of the extra sliding around Rochut is said to have used. For purposes of this page, the point is that Rochut - nor anyone else - would be able to play the trombone in a "slidey" way with their palms facing downward. 

#### Example 3: William Tell Overture 

The following is a demonstration video to help trombonists prepare audition material. Christian Jones demonstrates the same passages I use as a [sight-reading example](clues-example-3.md) on this site. 

In these demonstrations the players aren't using the slide positions I mention in the sight-reading example because they're playing the original orchestral version in E minor, not the band transcription in F minor. You can still see they choose slide positions that minimize changes of direction and distance.

[Christian Jones - "William Tell"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-VX-yxcT-gA) 

While he doesn't flex his wrist, his slide technique is "slidey" rather than "snappy." The slide moves smoothly and fluidly. He articulates the notes at the right moments, but doesn't try to "snap" the slide into each position. 

Here's another demonstration. Davis Guo plays the same excerpt. 

[David Guo - "William Tell"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9m5uz5EBoQ)

The "slidey" slide technique is even clearer in this demonstration than in Jones'. Guo also doesn't flex his wrist, but he very obviously is not "snapping" the slide into position for each individual note. Yet, the correct notes speak clearly.
