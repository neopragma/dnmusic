# Trombone Posture 

By _posture_ I mean the way we hold the instrument when sitting and when standing. The trombone is a well-balanced instrument. With most designs, there is more-or-less equal weight behind and in front of our left hand. 

Jass trombonist Luke Malewicz has prepared an excellent instructional video on the correct way to hold the trombone. He explains everything step by step. He also demonstrates and explains several common mistakes and how to correct them.

In his narration he speaks as if he's addressing young students, but his advice applies to everyone. I've seen plenty of adult amateur trombonists who hold the instrument incorrectly, and who could benefit from this information.

Luke's video is very detailed and can help you avoid creating stress in your neck, shoulder, and back as well as positioning your head in a way that interferes with your airway. His advice covers playing in the seated position very well. 

Amelia, a trombonist and yoga teacher, offers complementary advice in her video on trombone posture. She demonstrates correct posture when playing in the standing position, and also talks about positioning the music stand.

Luke demonstrates trombone posture using a basic Bb trombone such as most people use for jazz playing. Most instruments of this type are very well balanced front to back and easy to hold for long periods of time. 

Amelia uses a symphonic tenor trombone with a Thayer valve (also known as an axial flow valve) for the F attachment. The tubing for the F attachment adds a little weight behind your supporting hand. The Thayer valve is much heavier than a standard rotary valve, so it adds more weight. You need to be aware of this and not allow the weight difference to cause you to drift into poor posture.

Tim Smith of the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra has a video that demonstrates good posture for playing the trombone and offers tips for positioning the music stand so that there's no interference with the slide and so that the player can see the conductor clearly.

In addition to basic information found in all these videos, Tim's description of the left forearm as a pillar of support is particularly valuable. It will help you avoid fatigue and possible damage to your wrist over time. 

He also published a one-page guide to good trombone posture. It's a PDF you can download for reference.

## Numbness or pain in the left arm

If you experience numbness or pain in your left hand, wrist, and/or forearm, it's likely your left hand position is a little off, and you're straining to hold the instrument. The strain may be slight, and you may not notice any discomfort when you first start playing. 

It should not become uncomfortable or painful to hold the trombone. If it happens, take it as a sign that you should review your grip and hand/arm position.
