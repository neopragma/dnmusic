# Breathing

The euphonium and trombone are wind instruments. Unsurprisingly, a wind instrument needs a steady supply of wind in order to make sounds. 

Three breathing techniques pertain to the these instruments: Normal breathing, quick short breaths, and circular breathing. We use each of these in different musical contexts. 

_Staggered breathing_ is an ensemble-playing technique for situations when the section must sustain a note for a long time, or when a moving passage is too long to play in one breath. 

Most people say staggered breathing only means the section members take turns breathing, and leave it at that; but there's a little more involved in doing it well. I'll discuss it further after covering the three basic breathing techniques.

## About breathing

Nearly always, we breathe normally when playing. Quick short breaths and circular breathing are only needed in certain situations. 

In the context of playing a wind instrument, "normal breathing" doesn't literally mean "breathe as you normally do when walking around." 

We need to take in enough air to sustain a strong air stream. We need to do that in a way that isn't noisy, uncomfortable, or tiring. 

Our breathing isn't part of the music we're playing, so we don't want to distract the audience by making it obvious. You've probably heard players who make a loud sucking noise when they inhale. That isn't necessary or desirable.

### How we breathe

Our lungs are our bodies' containers for air. That's why people talk about increasing our lung capacity. With larger lungs, we can take in and hold more air. 

The problem with this idea is that the size of our lungs is more-or-less fixed. They are inside a frame - the ribcage. We can't really increase the capacity of our lungs through breathing exercises any more than we can make our arms longer by lifting weights. 

But we _can_ improve the strength and the neuromuscular connections of the muscles that control our breathing - the diaphragm. Just as we build muscle tone and strength in our arms by lifting weights (without making our arms longer), we can build muscle tone and strength in our diaphragm (without making our lungs bigger). 

It's also possible to do exercises that enable the ribcage to stretch a bit more. This enables the lungs to expand a little further, although they don't actually grow larger. 

### Breathing exercises 

This video by Dr. Mandell demonstrates a couple of simple exercises that help increase your body's ability to pull air into the lungs:

Those of you who practice martial arts will recognize the first of Dr. Mandell's exercises as similar to _tao breathing_ exercises or _tai chi_ exercises. Here's a short video that demonstrates several useful breathing exercises from that tradition:

Tao breathing has an additional benefit - it helps alleviate stress and tension, and helps us relax. That's directly applicable to playing an instrument. 

Most people give little thought to _how_ they breathe. The body automatically inhales and exhales so it won't drop dead on the spot, and we just take it for granted. 

But if we want to control our air stream with our diaphragm, we need to breathe in a certain way, known as _diaphragmatic breathing_. 

This video by nurse Michelle Kenway demonstrates a simple exercise to improve our diaphragmatic breathing:

The benefits of diaphragmatic breathing include better control of our air stream for playing our instrument and the relief of tension or anxiety, which is also helpful for our playing.
