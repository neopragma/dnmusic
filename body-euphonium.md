# Body mechanics - euphonium 

Together, you and your euphonium constitute a musical instrument. The two parts must work together seamlessly. For that to happen, you need a clear understanding - and full control - of what's happening with your body when you play. 

This aspect of mastering the euphonium involves the following elements:

- [breathing](breathing.md) 
- [posture](euphonium-posture.md) 
- [embouchure](embouchure.md)
- [resonating chamber](resonating-chamber.md) 
- [articulation](articulation.md) 
- [technic](euphonium-technic.md)
