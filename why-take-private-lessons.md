# Why take private lessons?

Dave Nicolette 

Most of this material applies to any instrument. I offer private lessons on euphonium and trombone, so some of what follows is specific to one or both of those. 

Whether you're a student, an aspiring professional, or an adult amateur musician, private lessons may help you achieve your goals for playing an instrument. 

You can learn many aspects of musical performance by participating in school or community ensembles and by watching online videos that explain and demonstrate how to develop particular skills. 

Even so, there are aspects of playing that are difficult to pick up in a group setting or through videos. Those avenues don't focus on your individual needs. 

## What (possible) gaps can private lessons fill?

A school band or orchestra director who works with 100+ students each year and must prepare performances on a tight schedule lacks the time to listen closely to each student individually. Depending on the director's education and background, they may not understand your instrument on a deep level. 

University programs in Music Education prepare teachers to get students _started_ on all the instruments, but no one can be an expert in every instrument. If your band director happens to specialize in the same instrument as you, or even the same type - woodwind, brass, etc. - you're in a better position than otherwise. 

While some group music teachers have a background in performance, the majority are trained specifically in pedagogy and have never been the principal or section lead in a professional or high-level amateur band or orchestra. Depending on your aspirations, they may or may not be able to advise you on matters such as how to function effectively as a section leader or how to prepare for advanced auditions.

Online videos are a great resource. I wish they had been around when I was young. But videos are one-way communication. However knowledgeable the presenter may be, they can't see or hear you, so they have no way to recognize any specific issues you may be having with your playing. If you could work with them in person, they could pinpoint your problems and recommend effective exercises to correct them. Watching their videos can certainly help you progress, but only up to a point. 

Private lessons can help with the following aspects of playing an instrument. 

## 1. Direction

_This topic pertains to any instrument._

Many music students who participate in band and orchestra programs know they "should" practice their instruments, but they aren't sure how much time to dedicate to practicing and they may not be sure exactly what to do when they're practicing beyond playing scales and reading through their band or orchestra parts. Private lessons can help you set a direction for your work on the instrument that aligns with your personal goals and your other interests and obligations, and help keep your practicing focused on those goals. 

### 1.1. Goal-setting 

Goal-setting is important in many areas of life. It comes down to a single question: What do you want to accomplish, and when? You should think about what you want to accomplish with your instrument in the long term. That will become your goal for practicing the instrument. 

With a long-term goal in mind, you can craft intermediate goals. For instance, if you want to qualify for one of the primary US military service bands when you graduate from university, or if you aspire to a position with a professional orchestra, or if you want to become a professional studio musician or a touring soloist and recording artist, you will want to set intermediate goals for where you want to be after the next 12 months, by the end of high school, by the end of university, or at other milestones that make sense for you. 

On the other hand, your goals for playing may be more modest. Maybe you enjoy playing and you want to continue participating in bands as an adult, but you aren't interested in becoming a professional musician. That long-term goal will lead you to set different intermediate goals than you would if you were aiming for a career in music. 

If you're an adult amateur who wants to contribute as well as possible to your local community band or orchestra, but you don't want to invest excessive time in practicing, then your long-term and intermediate goals will be different again.

Whatever your larger goals may be, you'll want to keep grinding them down into finer-grained, more focused goals, to the point that you have specific goals for each practice session, and even for the next attempt to play a given etude or solo or technique that you are working on at the moment. 

Effective practicing isn't just random playing. Everything you do must have a purpose. Your goal is your purpose.

That said, you may sincerely have a particular goal in mind for your playing today, and that may change next year. That's perfectly okay. It's important to revisit your goals from time to time to ensure they are still meaningful for you. 

A private instructor may be able to help you understand what is possible and what you have to do to get there. 

### 1.2. Life balance 

Understanding how music fits into your life is important for setting realistic goals. A person who is fully dedicated to mastering their instrument will be able to commit to more practice time and a more ambitious program of development than a person who has two or three other interests of equal or greater priority, or who has responsibilities such as full-time work or supporting a family. 

It may sound really cool to be the principal trombonist with the New York Philharmonic or the solo euphoniumist with the United States Marine Band, but if you have to balance music with several other things in your life then it may not be a realistic goal for you. 

### 1.3. Commitment 

Once you have set realistic goals that don't conflict with other interests and responsibilities in your life, you can make a personal commitment to a program of development, including a given amount of practice time per week. Without such a commitment, it's possible you will only practice occasionally or when there's nothing else going on. 

An honest commitment to practice is necessary, and it must be a commitment you can realistically maintain. When you have to meet with a private instructor on a regular schedule, it can help you stick to your commitment for practicing. 

### 1.4. Self-awareness 

A final element to consider is self-awareness. Your progress will not be a straight line. You will have good days and bad days. Understanding yourself - how you're feeling, whether you're stressed due to other things happening in your life - will help you get the most value from your practice time. 

There will be days when it's better to skip practicing or to do your warm-up routine and then forego heavy work on the instrument. You need to develop the ability to make this kind of judgment so that you won't become frustrated and stop enjoying it. 

Sometimes a private teacher can see that you're having problems you don't notice, and can help you get some value from the day, even if it isn't your best day. 

## 2. Concept and mindful practice 

_This topic pertains to any instrument. Some content is specific to the euphonium or trombone._

Your _concept_ of the instrument will be your primary guide when you practice mindfully. Mindful practice based on a clear concept will enable you to get the most value from your practice time.

### 2.1. Concept

Musicians develop a _concept_ of their instrument (or voice) that guides their practice and development. Your concept is your idea of the character of the instrument. 

The idea that an instrument has a "character" isn't entirely concrete; it's subjective to an extent. Yet, there is a general consensus about what each instrument should sound like and how one should approach playing it. 

Your personal concept of the instrument should be based on that general consensus, and can reflect your personal preferences about how the instrument should sound, as well. 

For the euphonium, many people use words like _dark_, _rich_, _mellow_, _sweet_, and _full_ to describe the sound. For the trombone, many people use words like _centered_, _round_, _resonant_, _clear_, and _full_. All these words are subject to interpretation and individual preference.

Developing a concept for an instrument is largely a matter of listening carefully to many different top-level players and internalizing the timbre and approach that you find most pleasing. Different players approach the instrument differently, and have their own unique sound. There is no single "correct" concept, but there is a broad consensus. 

Your personal concept of an instrument should be firmly based on that broad consensus, or you will have difficulty passing any university or professional auditions. They don't want people whose sound is so "unique" that it muddies the section, or that is very different from what people expect the instrument to sound like.

Cultivating a good concept is easier to accomplish with guidance from a private teacher. Group teachers such as band directors lack the time to devote this level of focus to each student and each instrument. 

### 2.2. Mindful practice  

_This topic pertains to any instrument._

It has been said that 10,000 hours of practice are necessary to master any given skill. But people who have studied how humans develop skills have come to a slightly different conclusion. They have found _mindful practice_ to be more important than the sheer number of hours of practice. 

What is your mind full of when you're practicing mindfully? The main thing is your concept of the instrument. Each time you push air into the instrument, you should be thinking consciously about exactly what sounds you want to emerge from the bell. 

That includes factors such as your posture and breathing, the timbre (quality of sound), pitch precision, envelope of the sound, articulation, vibrato (or not), clean transitions between notes, phrasing, and style of the music. When you play, you are consciously comparing the result with your intentions. 

A private teacher can help you understand what to listen for and how to address any issues with your sound, technic, breathing, and other details. 

### 3.3. Visualization 

The mental discipline called _visualization_ is sometimes described as little more than "imagining" what you want, but there is more to it than that. The idea is to train your brain to operate as if your end goal were already a reality. It can be a powerful way to amplify the value of your practicing and help you progress toward your goals. It is also one way of minimizing the negative effects of nervousness.

The two types of visualization - _outcome visualization_ and _process vizualization_ - work in tandem to set you up for success. These techniques help you understand what to focus on and what to ignore when inundated with information, and thus to make the best possible use of limited practice time. 

You may be able to figure out visualization on your own by reading books and websites, but if you work with a private teacher who has experience (outside the world of music) with things like organizational improvement, business coaching, management, and team dynamics, you can gain an edge over those competing with you for positions in honor groups such as your state's All State Band, openings in professional ensembles, and places in the university of your choice.

## 4. Understanding sound 

_This topic pertains to any instrument._

It's helpful to gain an understanding of how sound works. After all, when we play music we are making sounds through our instrument. There are two aspects of sound to learn about - the _physics_ of sound and the _human perception_ of sound. 

### 4.1. Acoustics

The physics of sound is called _acoustics_. To play an instrument, we need to understand something about acoustics and how sound operates within the particular instrument. This includes topics such as waves, periodic waves, standing waves, wave propagation, wave reflection, resonance, harmonics, and the overtone series. We directly operate on these things when we play. If we don't understand what's happening acoustically, our playing will be somewhat random, and we won't be able to assess the reasons why. 

### 4.2. Human perception of sound

It's also important to understand how the human ear and brain process sound. We don't necessarily process sound exactly as it exists physically. Some of the words that describe the general concept of the euphonium or trombone come down to our perception of sound, and they don't have precise meanings - _dark_, _rich_, _mellow_, _sweet_, _centered_, _round_, _full_. 

Understanding the nuances will help in developing a good concept of the instrument. 
In addition, our sense of when the music sounds "in tune" or "out of tune" comes from the way our brains process sound. 

It's critically important to play in tune. Some people say "perfect pitch" or "perfect relative pitch" are gifts. Either you're born with them or you aren't. But the reality is that the ear can be trained. A good private teacher will include ear training in your improvement program. 

Many of these topics are interrelated. For instance, ear training will help you develop stronger sight-reading skills and better pitch precision. 

### 4.3. Envelope

The envelope of a sound describes the "shape" of the sound, in a sense. It comprises four elements: _attack_, _sustain_, _decay_, and _release_. The _attack_ describes how the sound begins, and the _release_ describes how it ends. Between the beginning and the end of the sound, there is a period of time when the sound _sustains_ before it _decays_ and finally _releases_.

Every sound, not only musical sounds, has an envelope. Every sound produced by a voice or through an instrument has all four elements of the envelope, including very short sounds such as a tap on a wood block. 

Your concept of the euphonium or trombone and your mental image of each sound you intend to produce should include this aspect of sound. Being intentional about it will help you play consistently and cleanly. It is a detail often overlooked in standard group music teaching, but is important for individual mastery of an instrument or the voice.

## 5. Your body and your instrument 

_This topic generally pertains to any instrument, but the content here is focused on the euphonium and trombone. Some details may not be relevant to other instruments._ 

Together, you and your euphonium or trombone constitute a musical instrument. The two parts must work together seamlessly. For that to happen, you need a clear understanding - and full control - of what's happening with your body when you play. 

### 5.1. Breathing 

The euphonium and trombone are wind instruments. It may be painfully obvious, but a wind instrument needs a steady supply of wind in order to make sounds. Perhaps less obvious is the fact three breathing techniques pertain to the these instruments: Normal breathing, quick short breaths, and circular breathing. We use each of these in different musical contexts. 

This is another aspect of playing that your group music teacher may not have time to cover, due to the large number of students they must teach within a limited time. 

### 5.2. Posture

Posture has a profound effect on breathing. The euphonium is a relatively large and heavy instrument. In addition, some euphonium designs require us to hold the instrument a little bit sideways, making us support its weight with one arm. Depending on how we hold it, both when sitting and when standing, we may interfere with our ability to breathe freely or to move our fingers flexibly. 

The trombone is well balanced due to its physical design, and quite easy to hold in a relaxed way whether standing or sitting. 

### 5.3. Embouchure

The embouchure consists of the muscles of the face that control how our lips buzz. While group music teachers such as band directors learn the basics of how to play most of the instruments in the main instrument groups - strings, woodwinds, brass, and percussion - they may not be familiar with the details of embouchure development for any given wind instrument other than the one or two they specialize in. They know enough to get a young student started. 

As a result, many university-level euphonium and trombone teachers find they must break down and re-build most freshman students' embouchures from scratch because the students have received inaccurate advice and/or have fallen into bad habits. Having a private teacher who specializes in euphonium and/or trombone can help you avoid this set-back in your progress toward your long-term goal.

### 5.4. Resonating chamber 

The inside of our mouth forms a resonating chamber when we are playing. The standing periodic wave we produce when we play exists partly in the bore of the instrument and partly inside our mouths. The placement of our tongue and jaw, how widely we open our throat, and the shape of the soft palate all affect the quality of sound we produce. 

Understanding how this works and learning to control it will help you match your actual playing with your concept of the instrument. It's unlikely a school band or orchestra director will have time to get into this topic. A private teacher can provide guidance.

### 5.5. Articulation

_Articulation_ consists of brief interruptions of the air flow to realize various styles of playing, such as _legato_ (connected), _sostenuto_ (sustained), _marcato_ (separated), _staccato_ (short), _leggiero_ (light), _secco_ (dry), and more. We interrupt the air flow using our tongue or glottis. Multiple tonguing techniques (double and triple tonguing) involve alternating between the tongue and the glottis to interrupt the air flow rapidly. 

In keeping with the idea of a _concept_ for our instrument and the importance of controlling the _envelope_ of each sound we produce, we want to ensure every note we play has consistent articulation. When using multiple tonguing, the notes should sound identical whether they are articulated with the tongue or the glottis. 

While articulation is an important aspect of playing, it seems to receive inadequate attention in group musical situations. In some cases, a school band teacher will advise students to start and/or stop each tone with their tongues. This is incorrect, but may be a practical short-cut to getting a group of inexperienced musicians to sound more-or-less consistent for purposes of a school concert. That doesn't mean it is something you should do in your individual playing.

In reality, the mechanics of starting and stopping a tone are different from the mechanics of articulation. When you play a series of notes in a particular style, such as _staccato_, you will articulate the first note in the series, of course. But that is a different "operation" than starting the tone, which is a matter of buzzing the lips and has nothing to do with the tongue. 

A private teacher can help you understand these nuances and develop the skills in an appropriate way. 

### 5.6. Pitch precision 

It's important to play each note on exactly the right pitch, but instruments like the euphonium and trombone do not automatically play the correct pitches. We produce the pitch with our lips and create a standing periodic wave by pushing air into the mouthpiece while we buzz. If the pitch we produce happens to "fit" in the instrument, then a nice-sounding note comes out the bell. If it doesn't quite fit, then the instrument "fights" us and doesn't "want" to produce that pitch.

These instruments are essentially metal tubes 9 feet (about 2.74 meters) long. A single standing wave in the tube vibrates at 58.27 Hertz, which is Bb2. That is the _fundamental_ or _first partial_ of both a Bb euphonium and a Bb trombone. With all valves open or with the slide in 1st position, we can play the _overtone series_ over Bb2. 

By controlling our lips, if we buzz a Bb3 we will have two wavelengths inside the instrument, each exactly half as long as the 9-foot tube. That's the _second partial_. If we buzz a wavelength between the fundamental and the second partial, the instrument will not "want" to produce that pitch. 

The _third partial_ is F3, and there are three wavelengths inside the tube. The fourth partial is Bb3, the fifth is D4, and so on. The overtone series continues in that way. The wavelengths are all integral subdivisions of the fundamental. So if you play the 8th partial, Bb4, there are eight waves in the tube.

To fill in all the other notes besides the overtone series over Bb, we make the tube longer. On the trombone, we do that by extending the slide. On the euphonium, we do it by engaging the valves, each of which routes the air through some amount of additional tubing. 

So, with the second valve closed or the slide in 2nd position, we can play the overtone series over A. With the first valve closed or the slide in 3rd position, we can play the overtone series over Ab. And so on. 

Like other valved instruments, the euphonium has inherent intonation problems. This is because the length of tubing we need to add for each note is _proportional_ to the wavelength of the note, while the physical tubing is of _fixed_ length. The lower we play, the more obvious the discrepancy in pitch becomes. 

Also, when we use more than one valve at the same time, the intonation goes farther off. Different euphonium designs address this issue in different ways, and we need to learn how to make our particular instrument play in tune. 

With a valved instrument like the euphonium, using the right fingering gets you pretty close to the right length of tubing for the note you want to play. You may have to make some fine adjustments with your embouchure, but the instrument helps you to an extent. 

The trombone is different. It's the only wind instrument that _can_ be played perfectly in tune. The trade-off is that it doesn't help you get _close_ to the right pitch to begin with. You must place the slide in _precisely_ the right spot and _also_ buzz your lips at precisely the right frequency. While beginners learn there are 7 slide positions, in reality the slide can be positioned in infinitely different spots along its length. That's the reason it _can_ be played perfectly in tune...and the reason it doesn't _help_ you do so. 

You will find that trombonists as a community or a culture tend to be meticulous about intonation to a degree other brass players are not. They almost _have_ to be that way, or their intonation would be all over the map.

Although Western music is generally based on the well-tempered scale, particular notes in certain chords need to be adjusted up or down a bit so they sound okay to the human ear. Mastering this aspect of playing requires ear training and some knowledge of music theory.

In a group setting such as a school band or orchestra, the director usually begins a rehearsal by tuning the group. That involves listening to a tuning note and trying to match your sound to it, either by ear or with the use of a tuner. As soon as the group plays anything besides the tuning note, all bets are off. This doesn't help you learn to play in tune as an individual musician.

A private teacher can help you understand and master the details of playing in tune.

### 5.6. Technic 

The term _technic_ refers to the fluency with which we move from note to note, irrespective of the articulation we're using. In addition to breathing and embouchure, this involves the use of our hands to manipulate the moving parts of the instrument. For the euphonium in particular, our posture can also affect our ability to play fluently. So, technic is very much related to how we use our bodies in conjunction with our instrument. 

For the trombone, technic involves learning to move the slide smoothly and quickly with a minimum of wasted motion. We need to be aware of exactly where we are in the overtone series for every slide position. The way you hold the slide can make a significant difference, too. 

If you learn only from group music teachers who are trained in the basics, who do not specialize in the trombone, and who must devote most of their attention to the group as a whole, it's unlikely you will receive detailed guidance for this. 

I know several very good school music teachers who play the trombone as a secondary instrument, and play it reasonably well, and yet are unaware of any alternate slide positions, or of micro-adjustments trombonists make to correct for intonation issues with certain partials. I suspect this stems from a lack of awareness of which partial each note actually is in the overtone series. (See "meticulous," above.)

The euphonium, like other valved brass instruments, has some additional challenges beyond the trombone. The air stream passes through a channel in each valve that connects two tubes. When we open or close a valve, it covers one of those air passages and uncovers another. This is equally true for piston valves and rotary valves. 

Inevitably, there is a non-zero length of time when the air stream is split between two paths through the instrument. That makes a noise - "valve noise" - that can interfere with the music we're playing. Many players accept valve noise as an inherent characteristic of the instrument, but it can be a distraction for listeners. There are practical ways to minimize it, and exercises that help us develop that skill. 

Another way to reduce valve noise is to minimize the movement of the valves. Advanced players often use alternate fingerings for that reason, apart from using them to adjust intonation. Each design, each model, and to an extent each individual euphonium has its own characteristics. 

Posture affects technic and breathing on the euphonium, particularly for compensating models with the main three valves on top and the fourth valve on the side. This is because of the way our fingers are connected with the muscles of our forearm. 

A private teacher can offer guidance in this area beyond what your group music teacher can offer, unless they happen to specialize in the euphonium. Even then, they would have to work with you one on one, and they may lack the time for that.

## 6. Reading printed music 

_This topic focuses on printed music written for the euphonium and trombone._ 

The skill of translating the written representation of music into sound is important for success on the euphonium and trombone. 

### 6.1. Clefs and transposing parts

In a school band or community band, you will almost always see trombone parts written in bass clef, sounding as written (that is, "concert pitch"). Occasionally, tenor clef is used. 

For the euphonium in a concert band, you will have a choice between bass clef, sounding as written, and treble clef in Bb, sounding a major ninth lower than written. Tenor clef is rarely used, but does appear in concert band parts.

In brass bands, both the euphonium and tenor trombone parts are written in treble clef in Bb, sounding a major ninth lower than written. 

But these are not the only ways music is written for these instruments. Here is a summary.

Trombone

- bass clef, sounding as written 
- tenor clef, sounding as written 
- alto clef, sounding as written 
- treble clef, sounding as written (some orchestral parts)
- treble clef in Bb, sounding a major ninth lower than written (brass band) 

Euphonium 

- bass clef, sounding as written 
- bass clef in Bb, sounding a major second lower than written (European band parts)
- tenor clef, sounding as written 
- alto clef, sounding as written (trombone music)
- treble clef in Bb, sounding a major ninth lower than written
- treble clef in Bb, sounding a major second lower than written (some orchestral parts)

It isn't someone else's responsibility to provide you with a part that you can read. If you're accustomed to reading treble clef in Bb, and your band only has bass clef parts available (or _vice versa_), you still have to cover your part. So you need to learn to read all these variations.

### 6.2. Sight reading  

In most school bands and community bands, it is expected that the musicians will struggle to read music they haven't played before. It's common to sight-read new pieces at a slow tempo, and to expect people to take their parts home to "woodshed" them. Individual players learn their parts note by note, beat by beat, through repetition. 

At more advanced levels, the expectation is that the musicians can play almost any music at sight. If you go to a rehearsal for a pit orchestra for a Broadway musical, you will be expected to play the music with no mistakes the first time (and every time). If you can't, it's easy enough for them to find someone who can.

When Broadway shows go on the road, they hire local musicians for the pit orchestra. They are given the original parts, which were written for different vocalists than the ones in the local production. We are expected not only to sight-read the music correctly, but to transpose it on sight to accommodate the vocalists. It's rare for them to have the same vocal ranges as the original performers. 

Professional orchestras and bands want to dedicate rehearsal time to fine-tuning the musical aspects of the pieces they will perform, and not spend time learning notes. Adding to the challenge, these ensembles often play harder music than school and amateur ensembles. 

Another aspect of sight-reading is interpretation. Music isn't just a string of notes. Every phrase in every piece of music is a statement that expresses something with emotional content. At an advanced level, we are expected to perform the music with appropriate interpretation, even the first time we play it. 

There are situations when even advanced musicians are not expected to get the music exactly right on the first try. Some music is extraordinarily difficult, and musicians have to work through it. Other music is esoteric or unusual in some way, and may not even be notated using staves and standard note shapes. This includes some pieces written for concert band. That sort of music has to be _explained_ before we understand what to do with it. 

But for the most part, we are expected to be able to sight-read conventional Western music quite well. Most of it consists of familiar building blocks - diatonic runs in a given major or minor key, repeating intervalic patterns, common rhythms, etc. 

It's like building different things out of the same Lego&reg; bricks over and over. That's the reason so much practice material emphasizes scales, arpeggios, and various intervalic patterns. We're making Lego&reg; bricks.

We shouldn't have to learn every piece note by note any more than we have to make the same Lego&reg; bricks again and again. Most of it is part of a musical tradition that should become more and more familiar to us as we practice day by day, and as we learn more about music history and theory.

Another aspect of sight-reading is to gain an understanding of the styles of various well-known composers. We can make a good guess about how to interpret music when we're familiar with the style of the composer. For musicians lacking knowledge of different composers and of music history, the name of the composer printed at the top of the page doesn't offer any clues for interpreting the music. Yet, that is often the best clue.

### 6.3. Sight singing 

One thing that helps greatly with sight reading is to sing or hum the music. Using our brains and voices to realize the printed music helps solidify the sound of intervals in our minds. That helps us with accuracy when we play the same music with our instrument. 

You don't have to be a good singer to practice sight singing. I'm a hopelessly bad singer, myself. I'm shy about singing Happy Birthday at parties. Karaoke? Forget it! But that isn't the point of sight singing. The point is to build the connection between what we see on the page and what we hear in our mind's ear. 

### 6.4. Drumming 

As a way to build sight reading skills, _drumming_ means tapping on the table top or a pad. You can sight read snare drum etudes and tap them out with your fingers or with chopsticks. It doesn't matter if you play them as well as a percussionist. You don't need to get a feel for the sticks or anything like that. That isn't the point. The purpose is to build your skill in sight reading rhythms. You want it to become second nature.

### 6.5. No harm, no foul? 

Opinions vary as to how much should be "forgiven" when we're sight-reading. In my view, the translation from written music to sound should be more-or-less _automatic_ unless we're dealing with something unusual. The translation of music from one format to another - in this case, from printed to aural - can be handled by the back of our mind. The front of our mind should be free to think about musical interpretation rather than notes and rhythms. 

Sight-reading and transposition at sight are learnable skills. A knowledgeable private teacher can guide you in developing these skills.
