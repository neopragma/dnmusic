# Why take private lessons?

Some of the following will come across as if I'm trying to talk you out of taking lessons. That might seem strange, since I'm selling my services as a teacher. Yes, I enjoy teaching and yes, I could use the money, but I also want to be useful. 

If private lessons can help you, then great: let's talk. But you might not need them. So, let us reason together.

The first question to answer is: Would private lessons be helpful to _you_? 

## Goals and life balance 

To answer that question, think about your personal goals for improvement on the instrument. Private lessons are most beneficial when the student and teacher are working together toward a well-defined goal. 

If you don't have a clear goal, then this may not be the right time for you to get into private lessons. Think it over. There's no rush; especially if you have no goal.

### Can you state a goal?

A goal statement usually includes a target you want to achieve and a time frame for achieving it. Can you state a goal for your playing in that form - a target for your performance and a timeframe to get there? 

For example, if you're a high school student your goal might be: "I want to make All State Band by 11th grade;" or: "I want to win a competitive audition for a university scholarship two years from now." 

If you're an adult amateur, your goal might be: "I want to improve my sight-reading and expressive playing over the next 12 months so that I can contribute better to my community band;" or: "I haven't touched my horn in 20 years and I want to get back into playing so I can join a band next year." 

### Can you achieve your goal without private lessons?

Do you want to improve generally, with no specific goal in mind? You can always practice with an eye toward general improvement. There's nothing wrong with that. 

You may be able to do it on your own. Don't underestimate the effectiveness of self-discipline, study books, and YouTube videos. It's a powerful combination.

Private lessons will supplement the learning you can obtain through the people and resources already available to you. Do you need guidance beyond that level? 

### Does your goal for playing align with your life situation?

Is your goal realistic in view of your other interests and responsibilities in life? Are you an adult with a family to support? A student who has three or four equally-important interests besides music? Do you need to balance family time, friends time, and study time with practice time? There's a limit to how much you can realistically commit to. 

You need to be honest with yourself about this. Otherwise, you might agree to a practice schedule that you just can't sustain. 

## Matching students and teachers 

Musicians take many paths through life. Some are university educated, some are not. Some are trained as teachers, others focus on performance. Some teachers are better than others at teaching. Some full-time music teachers are also strong performers. Some performers can also teach; others struggle to explain things. 

There are several different university curricula in music, such as music education, music therapy, theory and composition, and performance. Within the area of music education, universities prepare two kinds of teachers to work in school systems - general music teachers who teach young children in a classroom setting, and band/orchestra directors who teach middle school and high school students in hopes of someday working at the university or professional level. 

If you are considering private lessons for your young child in the hope they will become the next Yuja Wang or Wynton Marsalis, it's a near-certainty they will be better off learning from the music teacher in their school. Putting them into private lessons will be a waste of time and money. 

General music teachers know how to introduce musical concepts to young children in an effective and enjoyable way. Those students rarely benefit from private lessons, in part because they have no goals and in part because they lack sufficient experience to benefit from the value-add a private teacher brings beyond what they're getting in school. 

To young children, music is an "activity," like soccer or ballet or martial arts. They are exploring various activities and they may discover one or two things that interest them. But for the moment, they are not ready for private lessons. You won't get value for your money.

## What's the value-add of private lessons?

You can learn many aspects of musical performance by participating in school or community ensembles, by watching online videos that explain and demonstrate how to develop particular skills, and by practicing on your own. 

Even so, there are aspects of playing that are difficult to pick up in a group setting or through videos. Those avenues don't focus on your individual needs. A school band director lacks the time to work with each student individually. Video is a one-way communication medium; the presenter can't see or hear you, so if you're not sure about something they can't help you.

While you certainly possess the native intelligence to figure everything out _eventually_, a qualified guide can help you stay on track toward your goals without wasting time going down blind alleys. 

In some areas - particularly embouchure development, articulation, and technic - there's a risk of practicing "the wrong way" and reaching a plateau in your playing, then having to backtrack and re-build from scratch. It's twice as hard to break bad habits than it is to cultivate good ones from the outset. A private teacher can help you avoid this all-too-common problem.

## What (possible) gaps can private lessons fill?

A school band or orchestra director who works with 100+ students each year and must prepare performances on a tight schedule lacks the time to listen closely to each student individually. Depending on the director's education and background, they may not understand your instrument on a deep level. 

University programs in Music Education prepare teachers to get students _started_ on all the instruments, but no one can be an expert in every instrument. If your band director happens to specialize in the same instrument as you, or even the same type - woodwind, brass, etc. - you're in a better position than otherwise. 

While some group music teachers have a background in performance, the majority are trained specifically in pedagogy and have never been the principal or first chair in a professional or high-level amateur band or orchestra. Depending on your aspirations, they may or may not be able to advise you on matters such as how to function effectively as a section leader or how to prepare for advanced auditions.

In a nutshell, a private teacher can augment what you can learn from your school or community band/orchestra director and on your own; details and nuances beyond the beginner and intermediate levels. So, if your goals don't call for much beyond that, you may not benefit from private lessons.

## Still not sure? 

My approach to private instruction is to use the first session to explore the prospective student's goals and to see whether we are comfortable working together. 

That first session is free. So if you're still not sure how to set goals or whether private lessons are for you, maybe we can figure it out together.
