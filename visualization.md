# Visualization 

The mental discipline called _visualization_ is sometimes described as little more than "imagining" what you want, but there is more to it than that. The idea is to train your brain to operate as if your end goal were already a reality. It can be a powerful way to amplify the value of your practicing and help you progress toward your goals. It is also one way of minimizing the negative effects of nervousness.

The two types of visualization - _outcome visualization_ and _process vizualization_ - work in tandem to set you up for success. These techniques help you understand what to focus on and what to ignore when inundated with information, and thus to make the best possible use of limited practice time. 

You may be able to figure out visualization on your own by reading books and websites, but if you work with a private teacher who has experience (outside the world of music) with things like organizational improvement, business coaching, management, and team dynamics, you can gain an edge over those competing with you for positions in honor groups such as your state's All State Band, openings in professional ensembles, and places in the university of your choice.
