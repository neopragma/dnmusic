# Understanding sound 

It's helpful to gain an understanding of how sound works. After all, when we play music we are making sounds through our instrument. There are two aspects of sound to learn about - the _physics_ of sound and the _human perception_ of sound. 

## Acoustics

The physics of sound is called _acoustics_. To play an instrument, we need to understand something about acoustics and how sound operates within the particular instrument. This includes topics such as waves, periodic waves, standing waves, wave propagation, wave reflection, resonance, harmonics, and the overtone series. We directly operate on these things when we play. If we don't understand what's happening acoustically, our playing will be somewhat random, and we won't be able to assess the reasons why. 

## Human perception of sound

It's also important to understand how the human ear and brain process sound. We don't necessarily process sound exactly as it exists physically. Some of the words that describe the general concept of the euphonium or trombone come down to our perception of sound, and they don't have precise meanings - _dark_, _rich_, _mellow_, _sweet_, _centered_, _round_, _full_. 

Understanding the nuances will help in developing a good concept of the instrument. 
In addition, our sense of when the music sounds "in tune" or "out of tune" comes from the way our brains process sound. 

It's critically important to play in tune. Some people say "perfect pitch" or "perfect relative pitch" are gifts. Either you're born with them or you aren't. But the reality is that the ear can be trained. A good private teacher will include ear training in your improvement program. 

Many of these topics are interrelated. For instance, ear training will help you develop stronger sight-reading skills and better pitch precision. 

## Envelope

The envelope of a sound describes the "shape" of the sound, in a sense. It comprises four elements: _attack_, _sustain_, _decay_, and _release_. The _attack_ describes how the sound begins, and the _release_ describes how it ends. Between the beginning and the end of the sound, there is a period of time when the sound _sustains_ before it _decays_ and finally _releases_.

Every sound, not only musical sounds, has an envelope. Every sound produced by a voice or through an instrument has all four elements of the envelope, including very short sounds such as a tap on a wood block. 

Your concept of the euphonium or trombone and your mental image of each sound you intend to produce should include this aspect of sound. Being intentional about it will help you play consistently and cleanly. It is a detail often overlooked in standard group music teaching, but is important for individual mastery of an instrument or the voice.
