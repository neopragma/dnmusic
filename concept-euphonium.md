# Euphonium concept

## Sound

Is there a "correct" euphonium sound?

The words _dark_, _rich_, _mellow_, _sweet_, and _full_ are commonly used to describe the ideal euphonium sound. Those words are subject to interpretation and personal taste. 

Different players, all striving to achieve a sound that aligns with those words, have different ideas about what, exactly, _dark_ or _rich_ (or whatever) actually sound like. 

While there are nuanced differences in how various players sound, there is a broad, general consensus about what a euphonium sounds like. As you develop your personal concept of the instrument, beware of deviating too far from the general consensus, or you will not pass any professional or university auditions. 

People don't want players whose sound "sticks out" from the section, because it muddies the ensemble sound. 

For solo work, audiences usually expect each instrument to sound a particular way, and they won't enjoy hearing an instrument played in a highly unusual way.

There are some links to YouTube videos at the bottom of this page that might help you get a sense of a "good" euphonium sound. 

## Embouchure development  

Many players emphasize [embouchure development](embouchure.md) over most or all other aspects of playing. They build their embouchures in much the same way as a bodybuilder sculpts their muscles.

When taken to an extreme, this can result in a "muscular" sound that some people find inconsistent with ideas like _mellow_ and _sweet_. Some players are unable to eliminate "air" sounds mixed with their tone at softer dynamic levels. 

Yet, embouchure development is very important. We can't progress very far on the euphonium without a well-developed embouchure. Advantages of a highly-developed embouchure include precision in note initiation, both in terms of pitch accuracy and clean attack; extended range, especially in the upper register; increased endurance; and consistent tone at all dynamic levels. 

At the other extreme, a single-minded focus on relaxed playing and developing a _sweet_ tone can leave the player with limited range, reduced endurance, imprecise note initiation, and a "cracked" sound at louder dynamic levels.

The key is to avoid both extremes; but exactly what constitutes "extreme" is a matter of personal judgment. Some players find the "muscular" tone perfectly suited to the instrument, while others find it harsh or rough. 

The players in the following two videos both have a sound consistent with the general consensus about the character of the euphonium. One has a more "muscular" sound than the other. Can you hear the difference? Do you have a preference?

Example 1: [Pasquale Cerone, "Gabriel's Oboe"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3F8-_FYJKTQ)

Example 2: [David Childs, "Gabriel's Oboe"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCqlMcUiFSk)

You must decide for yourself what sort of sound you prefer.

## Vibrato

Another subjective aspect of euphonium concept is the use of _vibrato_. Individual players may choose to use vibrato at all times. Others prefer to play with a straight tone most of the time and to apply vibrato selectively, for musical effect. Some say we should play with vibrato when soloing and not when playing in a section. 

There are also different musical traditions regarding vibrato on the euphonium. In Brass Bands, we use vibrato at all times, including when playing in a section. In orchestral music, we use a straight tone except when playing a solo passage. 

Finally, there are two widely-used methods to produce vibrato - jaw vibrato and diaphragm vibrato. Is one of these more characteristic of the instrument than the other? 

My view is that diaphragm vibrato is preferable. One reason is that vibrato is related to air stream control, and the diaphragm controls the air stream. With jaw vibrato, we must move our mouths to create the effect; and that is not the primary role of our mouths in playing. Doing this can interfere with embouchure control. 

Another reason is that players who learn jaw vibrato have difficulty turning it off when they need a straight tone. They have similar difficulty bringing vibrato into play and phasing it out in a controlled way when playing a long tone. In general, we do not see top-tier soloists using jaw vibrato.

## Valve noise 

Valve noise itself isn't a matter of "concept." It's a physical reality. But each player's _tolerance_ of valve noise is definitely part of their concept of the euphonium. 

### Air puffs

The valves redirect the air stream from one path to another. They do this by channeling the air stream between the ends of different tubes. This is the same for rotary and piston valves. 

Inevitably, there will be a non-zero length of time when the air stream is split between the old and new paths as we close or open a valve. 

Some players don't care much about this and consider the noise part of the character of the instrument. Others strive to minimize the noise to achieve smooth transitions between notes. 

For what it's worth, I'm in the latter camp. I tend to focus on clean playing to a greater extent than most players I know - to the point that they sometimes tease me about it. 

Many euphonium players insist they don't hear any valve noise when they play, even when it seems obvious to me. It's possible they have become accusomted to it and don't notice it. To make it easier to hear, let's compare some tuba players. 

Valve noise is more obvious on larger brass instruments than on smaller ones. The valves are larger and the tubes are larger in diameter, so on a larger instrument the time during a transition between notes when two tubes are partially covered is longer than on a smaller instrument. This kind of noise isn't really a problem on trumpet or cornet; it can be a problem on baritone or euphonium; and it's definitely a problem on tuba.

Listen to these examples and see if you hear any valve noise. Note: These are all professional-level players. The point is not to criticize them, but to help you cultivate a _concept_ based on the most "perfect" result you can imagine. A secondary point is to give you a sense of the expectations I will want you to set for yourself, should you engage me as a private teacher.

Example 1: [Jeremy Lewis, professor of tuba and euphonium at West Texas A&M University (2024)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6ZFSGdC44I)

In this video, Lewis demonstrates an etude that is used in auditions, to help students master it. It's a lyrical etude that consists mostly of slurred phrases. Valve noise is very noticeable in every transition between notes. We need to be conscious of this and not train our ears to ignore it. 

Example 2: [Eduardo Nogueroles, tuba solo from James Barnes' _Third Symphony for Band_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ribMR6UL2xg)

In contrast, Nogueroles' performance of this solo, played on a large tuba, illustrates clean transitions between notes without noticeable valve noise. This is the kind of smoothness we want to become part of our _concept_. 

Example 3: [Øystein Baadsvik plays _Czardas_ in his TED talk about the tuba](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtspakRGSB8)

Baadsvik is a professional soloist who brings the instrument to general audiences to raise awareness and appreciation for it. There's no question that he's an accomplished musician. But listen to the fast passages here and you may notice that while his fingers are manipulating the valves perfectly, almost all we can hear is valve noise and not clean notes. 

Example 4: [Wilfried Brandstötter and the Mnozil Brass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cf2x3nqKaM)

In this video, Brandstötter shows us that it's possible to play fast passages in any register on the tuba without introducing valve noise. This is what we want in our minds as part of our _concept_ of the euphonium. (His [audience engagement](audience-engagement.md) is also pretty intense.)

Another detail to notice in these examples is the players' [embouchoures](embouchure.md). Nogueroles and Brandstötter maintain an embouchure with tight corners and a flat chin throughout all registers of the instrument, while Lewis and Baadsvik tend to puff out their cheeks in the low register. 

Some teachers call this an embouchure "collapse." Many players do this on low brass instruments when they haven't developed their embouchures suffiently to play consistently in all registers. Be aware it is a workaround and not something to aim for; and don't overlook the difference in the results of players who develop their embouchures properly.

### Valve clatter

A second type of noise can occur when metallic parts come into direct contact. The instrument is made almost entirely of metal. 

The valves are designed to enable free movement while avoiding metal-on-metal contact. Some of the parts are made of non-metal materials - plastic, nylon, rubber, felt, etc. 

These parts - valve guides, silencer pads - wear out through normal use of the instrument, and must be replaced. This is part of routine maintenance of the instrument, but many players let a lot of time pass before they get around to doing it, and their valves may become quite noisy. 

I've seen this on all brands and models of euphonium. It seems to be a bigger issue on Bessons, because the valve caps are shaped like inverted cups, and their (relatively) sharp edges tend to cut through the silencer pads. 

But it happens on all euphoniums, even high-end models like Willson and John Packer Sterling, which have flat valve caps. 

Top professional soloists may not worry about this so much, as they receive instruments from manufacturers as a way for the manufacturers to promote their products through the soloists' public appearances, and through clinics sponsored by the manufacturers. They don't play a horn long enough for the non-metal parts to wear out. But for us mortals, regular maintenance of our equipment is advisable.

## Players to listen to

## Vocalists to listen to 

The character of the euphonium is similar to the character of the male opera voice in the baritone range. Listening to top-level singers can help cultivate a good euphonium concept. This is particularly helpful with respect to timbre and expressive interpretation.

## Good intentions, good information, but...

I've mentioned you can find all kinds of accurate and useful information on your own _via_ the Internet and books. Without the guidance of a teacher, you may not always recognize what is useful and what isn't. 

#### Example 1

This video is from the MusicProfessor channel on YouTube. The presenter makes good points about tone quality, as well as the importance of listening to yourself and trying to match your sound with a reference sound (what I call "concept"). He demonstrates three kinds of "bad" tone quality and accurately explains the causes. 

YouTube: [MusicProfessor good tone quality on euphonium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPgD4N0KGhw) 

But in my opinion, his demonstration of good tone quality still has some issues I do not think you should emulate, specifically: 

- <span style="font-size:90%">He rests the instrument on his lap instead of supporting it fully with his left arm.</span> 
- <span style="font-size:90%">Transitions between notes are not clean; there is valve noise.</span>
- <span style="font-size:90%">The timbre is partway down the road toward _dark_, _rich_, _mellow_, _sweet_, and _full_, but it's not there yet. The destination is still somewhere beyond the horizon.</span> 
- <span style="font-size:90%">The pronounced red ring around his lips after he plays indicates he is pressing the instrument against his mouth when he plays. This can interfere with the sound and cause the musician to tire quickly.</span>
- <span style="font-size:90%">Thanks to the aforementioned ring, we can see that he positions the mouthpiece off center. That means the muscles of his embouchure on the left and right sides cannot operate symmetrically. That interferes with embouchure control. A player can overcome this with practice, but it is unnecessary extra work if only we position the mouthpiece correctly. I want to point out that this is an easy habit to get into when we're playing a euphonium model that is held at an angle, because we automatically turn our face to the side unless we consciously self-correct.</span>
- <span style="font-size:90%">He sits perfectly still and doesn't seem to be engaged with the music, although the piece he has selected is highly emotional. His expression never changes and his body doesn't move.</span> 
- <span style="font-size:90%">He maintains unvarying vibrato throughout. This is the problem I've mentioned elsewhere whereby the musician appears to substitute vibrato for clean sound. We need to have a clean sound as a base and then add vibrato as appropriate for musical effect.</span>

#### Example 2

In this video, Staff Sgt. Irving Ray with the United States Army Band offers a beginning lesson in playing the euphonium in which he demonstrates how to play the notes Bb, C, and D. 

To qualify for the U.S. Army Band, one must be a top-notch musician. The auditions are highly competitive and the band is among the best in the world - probably in the top 5 globally. 

And yet there are still some issues with this demonstration. If you're trying to develop the best possible euphonium _concept_, be aware of the issues so that you can obtain useful information without also getting into bad habits. 

YouTube: [Irving Ray, First Notes: Bb, C, D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMBXmdQciSE) 

The issues I see in this case are: 

- <span style="font-size:90%">He is playing a non-compensating 4-valve euphonium with valves top, but he operates the 4th valve with the left hand. This necessitates reaching around the instrument and prevents him supporting its weight with his left arm. Therefore, he rests the horn on his lap. This can interfere with the airway.</span>
- <span style="font-size:90%">As in the previous example, he develops a red ring around his lips when he plays, indicating excessive pressure against the mouthpiece. This can interfere with embouchure control and limit endurance.</span>
- <span style="font-size:90%">The red ring around his lips is even more severely off-center than in the previous example. He must have had to work around this in order to develop strong playing skills; and he risks reaching a plateau in his playing that he won't be able to surpass without backtracking and "starting over" to an extent. This may also cause fatigue.</span>
- <span style="font-size:90%">He begins each tone with a fairly hard articulation. This suggests he may habitually start notes with the tongue, rather than separating the "operations" of starting the buzz and articulating the note. This can lead to rough starts in certain styles of music.</span>
