# Euphonium concept

## Sound

Is there a "correct" euphonium sound?

The words _dark_, _rich_, _mellow_, _sweet_, and _full_ are commonly used to describe the ideal euphonium sound. Those words are subject to interpretation and personal taste. 

Different players, all striving to achieve a sound that aligns with those words, have different ideas about what, exactly, _dark_ or _rich_ (or whatever) actually sound like. 

While there are nuanced differences in how various players sound, there is a broad, general consensus about what a euphonium sounds like. As you develop your personal concept of the instrument, beware of deviating too far from the general consensus, or you will not pass any professional or university auditions. 

People don't want players whose sound "sticks out" from the section, because it muddies the ensemble sound. 

For solo work, audiences usually expect each instrument to sound a particular way, and they won't enjoy hearing an instrument played in a highly unusual way.

## Embouchure development  

Many players emphasize embouchure development over most or all other aspects of playing. They build their embouchures in much the same way as a bodybuilder sculpts their muscles.

When taken to an extreme, this can result in a "muscular" sound that some people find inconsistent with ideas like _mellow_ and _sweet_. Some players are unable to eliminate "air" sounds mixed with their tone at softer dynamic levels. 

Yet, embouchure development is very important. We can't progress very far on the euphonium without a well-developed embouchure. Advantages of a highly-developed embouchure include precision in note initiation, both in terms of pitch accuracy and clean attack; extended range, especially in the upper register; increased endurance; and consistent tone at all dynamic levels. 

At the other extreme, a single-minded focus on relaxed playing and developing a _sweet_ tone can leave the player with limited range, reduced endurance, imprecise note initiation, and a "cracked" sound at louder dynamic levels.

The key is to avoid both extremes; but exactly what constitutes "extreme" is a matter of personal judgment. Some players find the "muscular" tone perfectly suited to the instrument, while others find it harsh or rough. 

You must decide for yourself what sort of sound you prefer.

## Vibrato

Another subjective aspect of euphonium concept is the use of _vibrato_. Individual players may choose to use vibrato at all times. Others prefer to play with a straight tone most of the time and to apply vibrato selectively, for musical effect. Some say we should play with vibrato when soloing and not when playing in a section. 

There are also different musical traditions regarding vibrato on the euphonium. In Brass Bands, we use vibrato at all times, including when playing in a section. In orchestral music, we use a straight tone except when playing a solo passage. 

Finally, there are two widely-used methods to produce vibrato - jaw vibrato and diaphragm vibrato. Is one of these more characteristic of the instrument than the other? 

My view is that diaphragm vibrato is preferable. One reason is that vibrato is related to air stream control, and the diaphragm controls the air stream. With jaw vibrato, we must move our mouths to create the effect; and that is not the primary role of our mouths in playing. Doing this can interfere with embouchure control. 

Another reason is that players who learn jaw vibrato have difficulty turning it off when they need a straight tone. They have similar difficulty bringing vibrato into play and phasing it out in a controlled way when playing a long tone. In general, we do not see top-tier soloists using jaw vibrato.

## Valve noise 

Valve noise itself isn't a matter of "concept." It's a physical reality. But each player's _tolerance_ of valve noise is definitely part of their concept of the euphonium. 

The valves redirect the air stream from one path to another. They do this by channeling the air stream between the ends of different tubes. This is the same for rotary and piston valves. 

Inevitably, there will be a non-zero length of time when the air stream is split between the old and new paths as we close or open a valve. 

Some players don't care much about this and consider the noise part of the character of the instrument. Others strive to minimize the noise to achieve smooth transitions between notes. 

For what it's worth, I'm in the latter camp. I tend to focus on clean playing to a greater extent than most players I know - to the point that they sometimes tease me about it. 

A second type of noise can occur when metallic parts come into direct contact. I've noticed this happening on Besson euphoniums. The valve caps are shaped like inverted cups. The problem may occur on other brands that have a similar valve cap design. 

The (relatively) sharp edges of the caps eventually cut through the felt pads that prevent metal-to-metal contact. Then we hear a clanking noise when the player closes a valve. 

Of course, this can be managed through routine instrument care; but it isn't a problem on models that have flat valve caps. The issue pertains to "concept" because different players will accept different levels of noise before they take corrective action. 

## Players to listen to 

In my opinion, these players exemplify the "ideal" euphonium concept with respect to timbre, clean transitions between notes, precision, expressive playing, technic, and audience engagement:

- Bastien Baumet 
- Roger Behrend
- Brian Bowman
- Anthony Caillet 
- David Ceste 
- Hiram Diaz
- Boonyarit Kittaweepitak 
- Demondrae Thurman
- Glenn van Looy
- Dave Werden 

In my opinion, these players are very close to the level of those listed above. Each is impressive in a many ways. 

- David Childs
- Emily Braverman
- Marina Boselli
- Nicholas Childs
- Kevin Fenske
- Mark Glover
- Algirdas Matonis
- Steven Mead
- Diego Lopez Ruiz
- Daniel Thomas

## Vocalists to listen to 

The character of the euphonium is similar to the character of the male opera voice in the baritone range. Listening to top-level singers can help cultivate a good euphonium concept. This is particularly helpful with respect to timbre and expressive interpretation.

## Expressive playing, stage presence, and audience engagement 

All professional euphonium soloists that I'm aware of tend to stand still while performing. Let's think about engaging with the music and with the audience as many other soloists do.
