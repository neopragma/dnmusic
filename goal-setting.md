# Goal-setting and time management 

In [Why take private lessons?](why-take-private-lessons.md), one of the first things I discuss is the importance of having goals for your playing. Without them, how would you know what to focus on when practicing? How would you find motivation to practice regularly? 

It's all well and good to _say_ you need to set goals, but not everyone knows how. I can help you define clear goals with timelines, break larger goals into achievable milestones, and manage your time to ensure you can maintain a realistic schedule of practice that fits into the rest of your life.
