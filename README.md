# Dave Nicolette - Music 

I'm a euphoniumist/trombonist and composer/arranger. Now retired, I live in Tucson, Arizona, US.

## Sheet music 

You can find my compositions and arrangements on the following sites:

- Sheet Music Direct - https://www.sheetmusicdirect.com/en-US/Search.aspx?query=Dave%20Nicolette 
- Sheet Music Plus - https://www.sheetmusicplus.com/en/explore?q=Dave+Nicolette 

New pieces are added regularly, so check back from time to time to see what's available.

Sheet music sites like to post YouTube links to published pieces, if any exist. If your group makes a video playing one of mine, please send me the link so I can add it to the description!

I also accept commissions. 

## Private lessons 

I'm interested in working with people who love the same instruments as I do, and who are at least _somewhat_ serious about improving their playing. Whether your goals are ambitious or modest, I can help you achieve them. 

If you're considering private lessons, let's talk. The first session is free, and will focus on understanding your goals for playing, what sort of realistic commitment you can make to practicing, and an assessment of your current performance level. Based on that we can decide whether to go forward and, if so, lay out a plan to meet your goals.
