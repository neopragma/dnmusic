## Sheet music 

You can find my compositions and arrangements on the following sites:

- [Sheet Music Direct](https://www.sheetmusicdirect.com/en-US/Search.aspx?query=Dave%20Nicolette)   
- [Sheet Music Plus](https://www.sheetmusicplus.com/en/explore?q=Dave+Nicolette)

New pieces are added regularly, so check back from time to time to see what's available.

Sheet music sites like to post YouTube links to published pieces, if any exist. If your group makes a video playing one of mine, please send me the link so I can add it to the description!

I also accept commissions. 

## Private lessons 

I'm interested in working with people who love the same instruments as I do, and who are at least _somewhat_ serious about improving their playing. Whether your goals are ambitious or modest, I can help you achieve them. 

If you're considering private lessons, please check out the information under [Why take private lessons?](why-take-private-lessons) It covers reasons you may or may not benefit from lessons, things to look for in a teacher, topics that can be covered in a program of lessons, and general information that might be useful to you in any case.
