# Audience Engagement 

## Emotional communication 

All professional euphonium soloists that I'm aware of (except Anthony Caillet) tend to stand still while performing. Let's think about engaging with the music and with the audience as many other soloists do. 

Alessandro Beverari, clarinet  
[E. Morricone, "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ws7Yj1BuXRI)

Yo-Yo Ma, cello  
[Camille Saint-Saens, "The Swan"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qrKjywjo7Q)

Katharina Mätzler, bassoon  
[W.A. Mozart, "Concerto in Bb Major"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TLQpI6nULdg)  
<span style="font-size:75%">Note: I think of this as Mozart's Euphonium Concerto. The euphonium hadn't been invented at the time he composed it. That goes to show he was ahead of his time.</span>

Bertrand Chamayou, piano  
[Maurice Ravel, "Pavane for a Dead Princess"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwL4nSb9am8)  
<span style="font-size:75%">Many musicians overthink and overembellish Ravel, but his style is uncomplicated. How do we communicate engagement with the audience when the music is nuanced? Here we see it isn't necessary to emote excessively to convey the sense that you are engaged with the music. Chamayou communicates a lot of emotion through posture and facial expressions. Beverari and Mätzler move quite a bit as they play. Is it too much? It's a matter of personal preference.</span>

Gautier Capuçon, cello  
[Gabriel Faure, "Sicilienne"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oZY4OJ4R-Y)  
<span style="font-size:75%">Another example of good engagement with the music without excessive body movement. We don't want to be stock-still, but we don't want to distract the audience's attention from the music, either.</span>
